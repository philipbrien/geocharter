geocharter
==========

geocharter is a Google GeoChart generator, running entirely in the browser.

How to use it
-------------

Enter countries or regions in the left column, and numerical data in the right. You can paste
directly from Excel, or your favourite spreadsheet program.

Then tune the settings for your chart, and click "Create map" to see your visualisation.

The boxes below the visualisation contain code to embed either the interactive visualisation
or a simple image into another webpage. These should work on any page (e.g. a blog post), with
no dependency on anything except Google's charting API.
